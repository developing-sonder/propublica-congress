   contain the root `toctree` directive.

PHP SDK for Propublica's Congress API
=======================================================

Something Here!

Installation
============

Requirements
------------
* php >= 7.2
* illuminate/contracts 5.1.*|5.2.*|5.3.*|5.4.*|5.5.*|5.6.*
* illuminate/support 5.1.*|5.2.*|5.3.*|5.4.*|5.5.*|5.6.*,
* guzzlehttp/guzzle ^6.3

Project Setup
--------------
.. code-block:: console

   composer install developingsonder/propublica-congress

Next you'll need to get an API Key from `Propublica.org <https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/#get-an-api-key>`_.
Once you've received you API KEY place it in the .env file in the root of your project.

.. code-block:: console

   PROPUBLICA_API_KEY=
   PROPUBLICA_API_VERSION=v1

At the time of this documentation, the Propublica Congress API's version is v1 and is the default used by ``DevelopingSonder\\PropublicaCongress\\Http\\Connection::class()``.
If you're using v1, you can remove that line, though we recommend you leave it for ease of upgrade later. The PROPUBLICA_API_KEY is required here.

HTTP Structure
==============
Something to follow here.

The Models
==========
The models represent each endpoint in the Propublica Congress API. Below you'll find references for all that are completed in our sdk.

Each request by the models returns result sets of 20. An offset can be supplied for pagination. The offset number must be a multiplier of 20.

The Clients
============
The Client classes hold the logic required to connect to the API. Their main purpose is to mirror the ProPublica Congress API and handle the response. Each endpoint will return
an instance of a ``DevelopingSonder\PropublicaCongress\Http\Response::class``.

In addition to the Response class being returned,  the Client itself will retain information about the last request which can be accessed through ``$lastResponse`` variable.
This can be useful when you want to repeat a call or for pagination of data as some endpoint will only return one page of 20 results at the time.

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   $client = new VotesClient;

   // Votes is an array containing STD objects of vote information.
   $votes = $client->recent('senate');

   // The $lastResponse variable is publicly accessible.
   $responseStatus = $client->lastResponse->status;

**Propublica's Pagination** returns page's of 20. The client classes contain an ``$page`` variable that allows you effectively designate a page of results to be returned. The
``$page`` variables index starts at 1.

The clients also include ``$client->nextPage()`` and ``$client->previousPage()`` methods that allow to quickly increment and decrement
the offset before immediately rerunning the last request.

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

      use DevelopingSonder\Clients\VotesClient;

      $client = new VotesClient;

      // Returns most recent twenty recent votes
      $response = $voteManager->recent('senate');
      $votes = $response->results();

      // Return the next 20 recent votes
      $response = $voteManager->nextPage();
      $votes = $response->results();

      // Return the previous 20 recent votes
      $response = $voteManager->previousPage();
      $votes = $response->results();

      // Return only the results array of the Response
      $votes = $voteClient->nextPage(true);

      // Convert response data to Resource Collection.
      $collection = new VotesCollection::make($recentVotes);

Votes Client
------------
The Votes Model gives you access to Congresses voting records.

Recent Votes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   use DevelopingSonder\Clients\VotesClient;

   $client = new VotesClient;

   // Returns most recent twenty recent votes
   $recentVotes = $voteManager->recent('senate');

   // Return the next 20 recent votes
   $recentVotes = $voteManager->nextPage();

   // Convert response data to Resource Collection.
   $collection = VotesCollection::make($recentVotes);

Members
-------
Members Client

Bills
-----
The Bills Client allows you to access the /bills endpoint of the Propublica Congress API. A ``DevelopingSonder\PropublicaCongress\Helpers\BillsCollection`` class
also exists to help convert array data into Bill's resources.

When a ``$type`` argument is present on a method you may pass one of the six following bill statuses:

``introduced`` ``updated`` ``active`` ``passed`` ``enacted`` ``vetoed``

Recent Bills
^^^^^^^^^^^^
``recent($congress, $chamber, $type)``

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

      use DevelopingSonder\Bills;

      $billManager = new Bills;

      // Return the Bills from the 115th Congress that passed in the Senate.
      $response = $billManager->recent('115', 'senate', 'passed');
      $bills = $response->results();

      // Return the next 20 recent votes
      $bills = $billManager->nextPage(true);

      // Create a Collection of Bills Resources
      $collection = BillsCollection::make($bills);
      $billSponsorName = $collection->first()->sponsor_name;


Recent Bills By Member
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``recentByMember($memberId, $type)``

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

         // Return the Bills from the 115th Congress that passed in the Senate.
         $response = $billManager->recentByMember('R000595', 'passed');
         $bills = $response->results();

         // Alternatively you can pass an instance of a Member Resource
         $member = MemberClient::find('R000595')->results();
         $bills = $billManager->recentByMember($member, 'introduced')->results();
